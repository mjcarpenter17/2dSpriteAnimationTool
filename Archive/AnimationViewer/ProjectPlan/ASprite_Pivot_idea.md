This is a **game-changing discovery!** Looking at that Aseprite JSON structure, I think you should seriously consider pivoting your approach. Here's why:

## **The Aseprite JSON is Superior:**

### **What You Get Automatically:**
- **Pre-defined animations** via `frameTags` (idle, run, jump, etc.)
- **Frame timing** with `duration` per frame  
- **Proper trimming data** with `spriteSourceSize` and `sourceSize`
- **Industry standard format** used by thousands of game developers
- **Professional tool integration** - artists already know Aseprite

### **Your Current Custom System vs Aseprite:**

| Feature | Your System | Aseprite JSON |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Animation Discovery | Manual folder scanning | ✅ Built into export |
| Frame Selection | Manual click-selection | ✅ Automatic via frameTags |
| Timing Data | Not implemented | ✅ Per-frame duration |
| Trimming/Pivots | Custom algorithm | ✅ Professional trimming |
| Artist Workflow | Learn your tool | ✅ Industry standard |

## **My Recommendation: Hybrid Approach**

Don't completely scrap your work, but **pivot to Aseprite-first**:

### **Phase 1: Aseprite Integration** 
```python
class AsepriteSpriteSheet:
    def __init__(self, json_path):
        self.data = self.load_aseprite_json(json_path)
        self.animations = self.extract_frame_tags()
        self.frames = self.extract_frames()
    
    def get_animation(self, name):
        # Return animation with frame sequence from frameTags
        
    def get_frame_data(self, frame_name):
        # Return x, y, w, h, trimming, duration
```

### **Phase 2: Enhanced AnimationViewer**
- **Primary Mode**: Load Aseprite JSON files
- **Legacy Mode**: Your custom frame selection (toggle setting)
- **Animation Browser**: Show frameTags as animation list
- **Preview Player**: Use duration data for proper timing

## **Updated Architecture:**

Instead of building complex animation discovery, your tool becomes:

1. **Aseprite JSON Loader** - Parse JSON and extract animations
2. **Animation Player** - Preview with proper timing
3. **Export Converter** - Convert Aseprite format to your game format
4. **Batch Processor** - Handle multiple Aseprite exports

## **Code Integration Example:**

```python
def convert_aseprite_to_game_format(aseprite_json_path):
    """Convert Aseprite JSON to your game's animation format"""
    aseprite_data = load_aseprite_json(aseprite_json_path)
    
    animations = {}
    for tag in aseprite_data['meta']['frameTags']:
        animation_name = tag['name']
        frame_range = range(tag['from'], tag['to'] + 1)
        
        # Convert to your format
        animations[animation_name] = {
            "frames": extract_frames_in_range(frame_range),
            "loop": tag.get('direction', 'forward'),
            "timing": extract_timing_data(frame_range)
        }
    
    return animations
```

## **Decision Framework:**

**Use Aseprite JSON if:**
- ✅ Artists are using Aseprite (very common)
- ✅ You want professional animation timing
- ✅ You need industry-standard workflow
- ✅ Animations have consistent structure

**Keep Custom System if:**
- You need very specific frame selection logic
- Working with non-Aseprite assets
- Need custom pivot point algorithms

## **My Vote: Go with Aseprite Integration**

This eliminates 80% of the complex work you were planning (animation discovery, frame selection UI, timing systems) and gives you a more professional result. Your AnimationViewer becomes a **game-focused Aseprite preview tool** rather than a full animation editor.

**Next Steps:**
1. Create Aseprite JSON parser
2. Build animation preview player using duration data
3. Add export conversion to your game format
4. Keep your custom system as a "manual mode" fallback

What do you think? The frameTags feature alone replaces your entire animations pane concept with something more robust!
