# UX Improvements - Smart Directory Handling

## Overview
Enhanced the file operations system to provide a much better user experience when opening sprite sheets and saving animations.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Smart Initial Directory Selection
When the application is first launched and "Load Sprite Sheet" is clicked:

**Priority Order:**
1. **Last used directory** (if saved in preferences and still exists)
2. **Assets folder** (`AnimationViewer/Assets/`) if it exists
3. **Assests folder** (`AnimationViewer/Assests/`) if it exists (handles typo in original)
4. **Application directory** (`AnimationViewer/`) as fallback

This ensures users start in a logical location rather than the default Documents folder.

### 2. Directory Memory System
**For Sprite Sheets:**
- Remembers the last directory where a sprite sheet was opened
- Saves this preference automatically when a file is selected
- Uses this directory for subsequent "Load Sprite Sheet" operations

**For Exports:**
- Remembers the last directory where an animation was exported
- Saves this preference automatically when saving
- Uses this directory for subsequent save operations

### 3. Preferences Integration
- Directory preferences are stored in the user's preferences file
- Survives application restarts
- Uses existing preferences keys: `last_sprite_dir` and `last_export_dir`
- Falls back gracefully if preferences are missing or directories no longer exist

## Technical Implementation

### File Operations Enhanced
- `EnhancedFileOperations` class now accepts `PreferencesManager` instance
- `_init_default_directories()` method loads saved preferences and applies smart defaults
- `_save_directory_preference()` method automatically saves directory choices
- Directory validation ensures saved paths still exist before using them

### Integration Points
- Main window passes preferences manager to file operations during initialization
- Works seamlessly with existing preferences system
- No changes required to existing preference dialog UI

## User Experience Benefits

### Before
- Always opened file dialog to Documents folder
- Users had to navigate to sprite sheet location every time
- No memory of previous locations

### After  
- Opens to the most logical location (last used, Assets folder, or app directory)
- Remembers user's directory preferences
- Provides consistent, predictable behavior
- Reduces clicks and navigation time

## Files Modified
- `ui/file_operations.py` - Enhanced with smart directory handling
- `ui/main_window.py` - Updated to pass preferences manager
- No changes to preferences structure (uses existing keys)

## Testing
- Application starts successfully with new system
- Directory preferences are properly loaded and saved
- Fallback logic works when directories don't exist
- Integration with existing preferences system is seamless

This improvement significantly enhances the user workflow by reducing repetitive navigation and providing intelligent defaults based on user behavior and project structure.
